# Stock-market-price-prediction
# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting stock prices using Linear Regression. The model is trained on historical stock price data and aims to forecast future prices based on relevant features.
# Model Architecture
The model utilizes Linear Regression, a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm, to establish a linear relationship between input features and stock prices. It assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (stock price).
# Dataset
We have used the tesla stock data. The dataset typically includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc.
# Usage
- Data Preprocessing: Ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed. This may involve handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, etc.

- Training the Model: Run the training script (train.py or similar) to train the Linear Regression model on your preprocessed dataset.

- Testing: After training, you can test the model's performance using a separate test dataset. This step helps evaluate the model's accuracy and generalization capability.

- Prediction: Once trained and tested, the model is ready to make predictions on new or unseen data. Provide relevant input features to the model, and it will output the predicted stock prices.
# Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version >= 3.0)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)
